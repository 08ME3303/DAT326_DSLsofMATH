``Domain Specific Languages of Mathematics'' is a project at Chalmers
University of Technology developing a new BSc level course and
accompanying material for learning and applying classical mathematics
(mainly real and complex analysis).
%
The main idea is to encourage the students to approach mathematical
domains from a functional programming perspective:
%
to identify the main functions and types involved and, when necessary,
to introduce new abstractions;
%
to give calculational proofs;
%
to pay attention to the syntax of the mathematical expressions;
%
and, finally, to organize the resulting functions and types in
domain-specific languages.

The first instance of the course was carried out Jan-March 2016 at
Chalmers and the course material is available on
\href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath}{github}.
%
The next step is to write up the lecture notes as a book during the
autumn, in preparation for the next instance of the course early 2017.
%
Contributions and ideas are welcome!
