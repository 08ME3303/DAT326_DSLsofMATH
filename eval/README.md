# 2017-02-06: Mid-course evaluation meeting

Present:
* Examiner and lecturer: P. Jansson
* Student representatives:
    * Daniel Heurlin, Oskar Vigren, Ari von Nordenskjöld

Could not attend:
* TAs: Frederik + Daniel
* ? Simon + Andreas ?

## Examination overview (as of 2017-02-06 morning):

Assignment 1 groups:
* 1 accept
* 10 minor reject
* 4 reject

## Input from the course representatives

Difficult weekly exercises: hard to get started. Please add more
information and more easy exercises.

Exercise sessions very good: friendly atmosphere, plenty of
opportunity to get questions answered, good TAs.

More lecture notes wanted. (Note that most are available in the 2016/
subdirectory.)

More specific litterature pointer wanted (for other complementing
material) for particular concepts (from lectures and exercises).

Assignment 1: more clarification of concepts wanted (definition of
|Elem|, more explanations).

Wed. lab room is suboptimal: only Windows computers, no Haskell
installed, cramped.

TODO[PaJa]: Rebook the Wed. comp. room from Cal.Week 7 (= study week 5).

Long term (for 2018): perhaps add a third hand-in assignment to make
sure students work more continuously.

## For reference: Results 2016

## Changes from the 2016 course instance

In 2016 the course was taught for the very first time, and by a
different teaching team (Cezar Ionescu, Irene Lobo Valbuena). The main
changes for 2017 are

* Re-worked the first four lectures (less logic, more Haskell)
* Re-ordering of lectures
* Replacing two guest lectures by new lectures on Linear Algebra

This was based on input from the 2016 course evaluation meeting:

    > Önskade förändringar (Desired changes)
    > * Ha introduktion till Haskell i början av kursen
    > * Ha mer exempel av linjär algebra
    > * Ha föreläsningars anteckningar innan föreläsningar
