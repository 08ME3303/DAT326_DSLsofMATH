Some notes about the pedagogical project DSLsofMath

2015-10-09: Meeting Eva Fülöp about how to collect material for a pedagogical paper

Background: The project is funded by the Chalmers CSE programme (D)
based and partly motivated by problems the students face in the third
year compulsory courses TSS and Regler. The course will be elective to
other students as well, but the the evaluation promised in the project
plan relates to the D students specifically.

The students take four maths courses in Y1+Y2P1, then have an elective
slot with DSLsofMath or ConcProg in Y2P3 and they take TSS and Regler
in Y3.
