Some notes about the pedagogical project DSLsofMath

2015-10-09: Meeting Eva Fülöp about how to collect material for a pedagogical paper

Background: The project is funded by the Chalmers CSE programme (D)
based and partly motivated by problems the students face in the third
year compulsory courses TSS and Regler. The course will be elective to
other students as well, but the the evaluation promised in the project
plan relates to the D students specifically.

The students take four maths courses in Y1+Y2P1, then have an elective
slot with DSLsofMath or ConcProg in Y2P3 and they take TSS and Regler
in Y3. Each D2 student will choose either DSLsofMath (the test group)
or ConcProg (the control group). The two groups will differ in many
respects, but we can calibrate to some degree by correlating with
their results on the earlier courses. After a year we can collect
their results on the TSS and Regler courses to see if there is a
statistically significant difference.

We aim at mainly following the D2014 cohort (students starting autumn
2014) who will take the first instance of DSLsofMath in early 2016 and
the following courses in the autumn of 2016.
