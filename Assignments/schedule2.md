The procedure is the same as for the first assignment: You need to show up for
your own group's slot, but you can't attend any other presentations. Since it's
a tight schedule, please be on time. Let us know if your slot doesn't work for
you (if there's a good reason for it), and we'll try to reschedule your
presentation.
