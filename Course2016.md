Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics
========================================

Aim
---

The course will present classical mathematical topics from a computing
science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced,
paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs
of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

Learning outcomes as in the [course syllabus]
(https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=24179).

Schedule
--------

- Lectures Mondays 10-12 (in ED) and Fridays 13-15 (in EB)

- Exercises Wednesdays 13-15 and Thursdays 10-12 (in E-studion)

- Guest lectures in Week 4 (Monday 2016-02-08 and Friday 2016-02-12)

- Exam: 2016-03-16 morning, re-exam: 2016-08-23 afternoon

Assignments
-----------

There will be two assignments, to be handed in using the Fire system.
Details will appear here.

Lectures
--------

Links to lecture summaries, slides, or other materials will be placed
here.

Literature
----------

There is no course textbook.  We will use many sources: references
will be provided in the lecture summaries.

Some important references:

### Functional programming

- **Thinking Functionally with Haskell**, Richard Bird, Cambridge
  University Press, 2014
  [URL](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/functional/)
- **Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell**, Richard
  Bird, Prentice-Hall, 1998.  A previous (but *very* different)
  version of the above.
- **An Introduction to Functional Programming**, Richard Bird and Phil
  Wadler, Prentice-Hall, 1988. A previous (but *very* different)
  version of *both* of the above.
    
### DSLs

- **Functional Programming for Domain-Specific Languages**, Jeremy
  Gibbons.  In *Central European Functional Programming School 2015*,
  LNCS 8606, 2015.
  [URL](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-15940-9_1)

      This is currently *the* standard reference to DSLs for the
      functional programmer.

- **Folding Domain-Specific Languages: Deep and Shallow Embeddings**,
  Jeremy Gibbons and Nicolas Wu,
  ICFP 2014. [URL](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication7584-abstract.html)

      Available at the same link: a highly recommended
      [short version](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/embedding-short.pdf)
      and the two videos of Jeremy presenting the most important ideas
      of DSLs in a very accessible way.

- **Programming Languages**, Mike Spivey.  Lecture notes of a course
  given at the CS Department in Oxford.  Useful material for
  understanding the design and implementation of embedded DSLs.
  [URL](http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/corner/Programming_Languages)
  
- **Domain Specific Languages**, Martin Fowler, 2011.
  [URL](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html)

      The view from the object-oriented programming perspective.

### The computer science perspective

- **Communicating Mathematics: Useful Ideas from Computer Science**,
  Charles Wells, *American Mathematical Monthly*, May 1995.  [URL](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/pdf/commath.pdf)

     This article was one of the main triggers of this course.

### Mathematics

- **The Language of First-Order Logic, 3rd Edition**, Jon Barwise and John
  Etchemendy, 1993.  Out of print, but you can get it for one penny
  from Amazon UK.  A vast improvement over its successors (as Tony
  Hoare said about Algol 60).

More references will be added in due course.
