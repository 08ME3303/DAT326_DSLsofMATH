# Mapping between 2016 and 2018

The files in this directory map each topic covered in the lectures of 2016 to
when it was covered in 2018.

## Format:

* Topic &rarr; Chapter X: The topic presented in this lecture of 2016 is covered in
    chapter X of the 2018 lecture notes.
* ?: This topic doesn't seem to appear in the 2018 lecture notes.
* If a sub-topic is marked with a different chapter or "?" than its super-topic,
    it means the sub-topic has moved or been removed, while the other sub-topics
    are still in the same chapter as the super-topic.
