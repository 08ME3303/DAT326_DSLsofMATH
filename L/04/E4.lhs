\begin{exercise}
\textbf{Homomorphisms.}
Consider the following definitions:
\begin{spec}
  -- |h : A -> B| is a homomorphism from |Op : A->A->A| to |op : B->B->B|
  H2(h,Op,op)  =  Forall x (Forall y (h(Op x y) == op (h x) (h y)))
  -- |h : A -> B| is a homomorphism from |F : A -> A| to |f : B -> B|
  H1(h,F,f)    =  Forall x (h(F x) == f (h x))
  -- |h : A -> B| is a homomorphism from |E : A| to |e : B|
  H0(h,E,e)    =  h E == e
\end{spec}

Prove or disprove the following claims:
\begin{itemize}
\item |H2((2*),(+),(+))|
\item |H2((2*),(*),(*))|
\item |H2(exp,(+),(*))|
\item |H2(eval',(:+:),(+))|
\item |H1(sqrt,(4*),(2*))|
\item |Exists f (H1(f,(2*).(1+),(1+).(2*)))|
  % |Exists f (Forall x (f.(2*).(1+) == (1+).(2*).f))|
  % |Exists f (Forall x (f (2*(1+x)) == 1+2*(f x)))|
  % |Exists f (Forall x (f (2*(1+x)) == 1+2*(f x)))|
  % Assume f = const c
  % |c == 1+2*c|
  % |-1 == c|
  % So, yes, there exists such a function, and |const (-1)| is an example.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
  Complete the instance declarations for |FunExp| (for |Num|,
  |Fractional|, and |Floating|).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Complete the instance declarations for |(REAL, REAL)|, deriving
  them from the homomorphism requirement for |apply| (in section

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  We now have three different ways of computing the derivative of a
  function such as |f x = sin x + exp (exp x)| at a given point, say
  |x = pi|.
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Find |e :: FunExp| such that |eval e = f| and use |eval'|.

    \item Find an expression of type |FD REAL| and use |apply|.

    \item Apply |f| directly to the appropriate |(x, x')| and use |snd|.

\end{enumerate}

  Do you get the same result?

\begin{exercise}
  \textit{From exam 2017-08-22}

  In exercise \ref{exc:e1_semiring} we looked at the datatype |SR v|
  for the language of semiring expressions.
  %
  We will now use some of the concepts discussed in this chapter to
  expand on this language.

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Define a type class |SemiRing| that corresponds to the semiring
      structure.

    \item Define a |SemiRing| instance for the datatype |SR v| that you
      defined in exercise 1.3.

    \item Find two other instances of the |SemiRing| class.

    \item Specialise the evaluator that you defined in exercise
      \ref{exc:e1_semiring} to the two |SemiRing| instances defined
      above.
      %
      Take three semiring expressions of type |SR String|, give the
      appropriate assignments and compute the results of evaluating,
      in each case, the three expressions.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that arithmetic modulo |n| satisfies the semiring laws (it is
  even a ring).
%
  In more details: show that |Zn = {0,1,...,n-1}| with |plus x y = mod (x+y)
  n| and |times x y = mod (x*y) n| forms a semiring.
%

  With |h x = mod x n|, show that |h| is a homomorphism from |ZZ| to
  |Zn|.

  \textit{From exam 2016-03-15}

  In exercise \ref{exc:e1_lattice}, we looked a datatype for the language of lattice
  expressions. We will now use some of the concepts discussed in this chapter to
  expand on this language.

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Define a type class |Lattice| that corresponds to the lattice
      structure.

    \item Define a |Lattice| instance for the datatype for lattice expressions
      that you defined in 1.4.1.

    \item Find two other instances of the |Lattice| class.

    \item Specialise the evaluator you defined in exercise 1.4.2 to the two
      |Lattice| instances defined above. Take three lattice expressions, give
      the appropriate assignments and compute the results of evaluating, in each
      case, the three expressions.

  \end{enumerate}

 \begin{exercise}
  \textit{From exam 2016-08-23}


  In exercise \ref{exc:e1_abMon}, we looked a datatype for the language of abelian monoid
  expressions. We will now use some of the concepts discussed in this chapter to
  expand on this language.

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Define a type class |AbMonoid| that corresponds to the abelian monoid
      structure.

    \item Define an |AbMonoid| instance for the datatype for abelian monoid
      expressions that you defined in exercise 1.5.1.

    \item Find one other instance of the |AbMonoid| class and give an example
      which is *not* an instance of |AbMonoid|.

    \item Specialise the evaluator that you defined in exercise 1.5.2 to the
      |AbMonoid| instance defined above. Take three `AbMonoidExp` expressions,
      give the appropriate assignments and compute the results of evaluating the
      three expressions.

  \end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
  (Closely related to exam question)

  A \textit{ring} is a set |A| together with two constants (or nullary
  operations), |0| and |1|, one unary operation, |negate|, and two
  binary operations, |+| and |*|, such that

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item |0| is the neutral element of |+|

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x ∈ A)      (x + 0 = 0 + x = x)
      \end{spec}

    \item |+| is associative

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x, y, z ∈ A)     (x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z)
      \end{spec}

    \item |negate| inverts elements with respect to addition

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x ∈ A)      (x + negate x = negate x + x = 0)
      \end{spec}

    \item |+| is commutative

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x, y ∈ A)      (x + y = y + x)
      \end{spec}

    \item |1| is the unit of |*|

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x ∈ A)     (x * 1 = 1 * x = x)
      \end{spec}

    \item |*| is associative

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x, y, z ∈ A)      (x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z)
      \end{spec}

    \item |*| distributes over |+|

      \begin{spec}
        Forall (x, y, z ∈ A)      (x * (y + z)  =  (x * y) + (x * z))
        Forall (x, y, z ∈ A)      ((x + y) * z  =  (x * z) + (y * z))
      \end{spec}

\begin{exercise}
  \textit{From exam 2017-03-14}

  Recall the type of expressions

  \begin{code}
  data FunExp  =  Const Rational           |  Id
               |  FunExp  :+:  FunExp      |  Exp  FunExp
               |  FunExp  :*:  FunExp      |  Sin  FunExp
               |  FunExp  :/:  FunExp      |  Cos  FunExp
               -- and so on
               deriving Show
  \end{code}

  and consider the function

  \begin{code}
    f :: REAL -> REAL
    f x = exp (sin x) + x
  \end{code}

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Find an expression |e| such that |eval e == f| and show this using
      equational reasoning.

    \item Implement a function |deriv2| such that, for any |f : Fractional a =>
      a -> a| constructed with the grammar of |FunExp| and any |x| in the domain
      of |f|, we have that |deriv2 f x| computes the second derivative of |f| at
      |x|.
  %
      Use the function |derive :: FunExp -> FunExp| from the lectures (|eval
      (derive e)| is the derivative of |eval e|).
  %
      What instance declarations do you need?

      The type of |deriv2 f| should be |Fractional a => a -> a|.

  \end{enumerate}


\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

  Based on the lecture notes, complete all the instance and datatype
  declarations and definitions in the files
  \href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/DSLsofMath/FunNumInst.lhs}{FunNumInst.lhs},
  \href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/DSLsofMath/FunExp.lhs}{FunExp.lhs},
  \href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/DSLsofMath/Derive.lhs}{Derive.lhs},
  \href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/DSLsofMath/EvalD.lhs}{EvalD.lhs},
  and
  \href{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/DSLsofMath/ShallowD.lhs}{ShallowD.lhs}.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Write a function
  \begin{code}
  simplify :: FunExp -> FunExp
  \end{code}

  to simplify the expression resulted from |derive|.
  %
  For example, the following tests should work:
  \begin{spec}
  simplify (Const 0 :*: Exp Id)   ==  Const 0
  simplify (Const 0 :+: Exp Id)   ==  Exp Id
  simplify (Const 2 :*: Const 1)  ==  Const 2
  simplify (derive (Id:*:Id))     ==  Const 2 :*: Id
  \end{spec}

  As a motivating example, note that |derive (Id:*:Id)| evalutes to
  |(Const 1.0 :*: Id) :+: (Id :*: Const 1.0)| without |simplify|, and
  that the second derivative looks even worse.

\end{exercise}
