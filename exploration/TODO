* Done: Add a few more tests:
** Done for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + unit laws for matrix mult
** Done for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + commutativity for matrix add
** Partly done for MatrixAlgebra1: some connections between matrix and vector
* Done: Experiment with larger matrices
* Done: From 4-tuples to data or newtype

New TODOs:
* Port Arbitrary instances MatrixAlgebra2
* Port Laws + tests to MatrixAlgebra2
* More from the Conjugate Gradients paper?
* Read http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/ClassLaws
* Sketch MSc thesis project proposal
