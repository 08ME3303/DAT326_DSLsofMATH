* 2015-10-20:
** TODO generators for specific matrix and vector dimension (untyped)
** TODO look at the possibility of a dimension-indexed datatype versions (Mat n a or similar)
** TODO get access to functional-feec and perhaps use some infrastructure (classes or types for Polynomials? Ring? Field? Vectorspace?)
** TODO Look at "power series, power serious"

* Research oriented special course
** TODO ReadFun with semirings: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/papers/semirings.pdf

* 2015-10-08:
** Done: Add a few more tests:
*** Done for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + unit laws for matrix mult
*** Done for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + commutativity for matrix add
*** Partly done for MatrixAlgebra1: some connections between matrix and vector
** Done: Experiment with larger matrices
** Done: From 4-tuples to data or newtype

* New TODOs:
** DONE Port Arbitrary instances MatrixAlgebra2
** DONE Port Laws + tests to MatrixAlgebra2
