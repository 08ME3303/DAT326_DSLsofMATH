* 2015-10-20:
** TODO generators for specific matrix and vector dimension (untyped)
** TODO look at the possibility of a dimension-indexed datatype versions (Mat n a or similar)
** TODO get access to functional-feec and perhaps use some infrastructure (classes or types for Polynomials? Ring? Field? Vectorspace?)
** TODO Look at "power series, power serious"

   CLOSED: [2015-10-19 Mon 16:48]
** More from the Conjugate Gradients paper?
** Read http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/ClassLaws

* 2015-09-28
** DONE Add a few more tests:
*** DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + unit laws for matrix mult
*** DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: associativity + commutativity for matrix add
*** Partly DONE for MatrixAlgebra1: some connections between matrix and vector
** DONE Experiment with larger matrices
** DONE From 4-tuples to data or newtype
