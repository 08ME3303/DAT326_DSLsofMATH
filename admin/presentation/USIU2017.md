Title:	Domain Specific Languages of Mathematics: Functions and Types for Learning
Author keywords:
Course development
Computational thinking
Didactics of mathematics
Functional Programming

Abstract:	We present the approach underlying a course on Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics, currently being developed at Chalmers in response to difficulties faced by third-year students in learning and applying classical mathematics (mainly real and complex analysis). The main idea is to encourage the students to approach mathematical domains from a functional programming perspective: to identify the main functions and types involved and, when necessary, to introduce new abstractions; to give calculational proofs; to pay attention to the syntax of the mathematical expressions; and, finally, to organise the resulting functions and types in domain-specific languages.

The course is semi-compulsory for second year computer science (D) students at Chalmers and elective for several other groups. The second instance of the course has just finished and we will report on the results and attempt to evaluate if the course fulfills it purpose.
