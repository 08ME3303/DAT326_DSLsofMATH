# Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics

Homepage for the 2018 instance of a 7.5hec BSc course at Chalmers and GU.

Homepage: https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/

Course codes: DAT326 / DIT982

## News

* 2017-09-28: First draft of the course page for the 2018 instance

## Course team

* Examiner & main lecturer: Patrik Jansson (patrikj AT)
* Lecturer: Cezar Ionescu (cezar AT)
* Teaching assistants: TBD (was Daniel Schoepe (schoepe AT), Frederik Hangh√∏j Iversen (hanghj AT student))

## Objectives

The course presents classical mathematical topics from a computing
science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced,
paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs
of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

Learning outcomes as in the
[course syllabus](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=26170).

* Knowledge and understanding
    * design and implement a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for a new domain
    * organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
    * explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
* Skills and abilities
    * develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
    * perform calculational proofs
    * use power series for solving differential equations
    * use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
* Judgement and approach
    * discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts

The course is elective for both computer science and mathematics
students at both Chalmers and GU.

## Course material

Lecture notes + references therein cover the course but there is no
printed course textbook.

The main references are listed below.

## Course setup

* Lectures (Prel. Tue. 13-15 in TBD, and Thu 13-15 in TBD)
    * Introduction: Haskell, complex numbers, syntax, semantics, evaluation, approximation
    * Basic concepts of analysis: sequences, limits, convergence, ...
    * Types and mathematics: logic, quantifiers, proofs and programs, Curry-Howard, ...
	* Type classes, derivatives, derivation,
    * Domain Specific Languages and algebraic structures, algebras, homomorphisms
    * Polynomials, series, power series
    * Power series and differential equations, exp, sin, log, Taylor series, ...
    * Laplace transform
    * Linear algebra
* Weekly exercise sessions (Wednesdays 13-15 and Fridays 13-15)
    * Half time helping students solve problems in small groups
    * Half time joint problem solving at the whiteboard

## Changes from last year

The main changes for 2018 (based on the [course eval meeting](eval/2017-04-28.md)) are

* New course literature (complete lecture notes)
* Developed more exercises to solve (primarily easier exercises to start each week with)
* Weekly hand-ins to encourage students to spend more hours on the course
* More solving of exercises at the whiteboard
* Schedule changes (alternating L, E, L, E instead of L, L, E, E)

## Examination

There are two compulsory course elements:

* Assignments (written + oral examination in groups of three students)
    * two compulsory hand-in assignments (2018-01-30, 2018-02-27)
    * Grading: Pass or fail
* Exam (individual written exam at the end of the course)
    * Grading: Chalmers: U, 3, 4, 5; GU: U, G, VG
    * Date: [2018-03-13 at 14.00](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=26170)
    * Aids: One textbook of your choice

To pass the course you need to pass both course elements.

## Lectures

The latest PDF snapshot of the full lecture notes can be found in
[L/snapshots](L/snapshots/).

The "source code" for the lecture notes are in subdirectories of
L/: [L/01/](L/01), [L/02/](L/02/), etc.
