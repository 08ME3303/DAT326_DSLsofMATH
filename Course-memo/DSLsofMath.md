# Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics

The 2017 instance of a 7.5hec BSc level course at Chalmers and GU.

Homepage: https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/

## Course team

- Examiner & main lecturer: Patrik Jansson (patrikj AT)
- Lecturer: Cezar Ionescu (cezar AT)
- Teaching assistants: Daniel Schoepe (schoepe AT), Frederik Hangh√∏j Iversen (hanghj AT student)

## Objectives

The course presents classical mathematical topics from a computing
science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced,
paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs
of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

Learning outcomes as in the
[course syllabus](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=24230):

-   Knowledge and understanding
    -   design and implement a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for a new
        domain
    -   organize areas of mathematics in DSL terms
    -   explain main concepts of elementary real and complex analysis,
        algebra, and linear algebra
-   Skills and abilities
    -   develop adequate notation for mathematical concepts
    -   perform calculational proofs
    -   use power series for solving differential equations
    -   use Laplace transforms for solving differential equations
-   Judgement and approach
    -   discuss and compare different software implementations of
        mathematical concepts

The course is elective for both computer science and mathematics
students at both Chalmers and GU.

## Course material

There is no course textbook.  We will use many sources: references
will be provided in the lecture summaries.

## Course setup

* Lectures (Mondays 10-12 in EB, and Mondays 15-17 in EF)
    * Introduction: Haskell, complex numbers, syntax, semantics, evaluation, approximation
    * Basic concepts of analysis: sequences, limits, convergence, ...
    * Types and mathematics: logic, quantifiers, proofs and programs, Curry-Howard, ...
	* Type classes, derivatives, derivation,
    * Domain Specific Languages and algebraic structures, algebras, homomorphisms
    * Polynomials, series, power series
    * Power series and differential equations, exp, sin, log, Taylor series, ...
    * Laplace transform
    * Linear algebra
* Weekly exercises (Wednesdays 13-15 and Fridays 13-15 in EDIT2505)
* Assignments: two compulsory hand-in assignments in groups of three students
    * Grading: Pass or fail
* Written exam
    * Grading: Chalmers: U, 3, 4, 5; GU: U, G, VG

## Changes from last year

In 2016 the course was taught for the very first time, and by a
different teaching team (Cezar Ionescu, Irene Lobo Valbuena). The main
changes for 2017 are

* Re-worked the first four lectures (less logic, more Haskell)
* Re-ordering of lectures
* Replacing two guest lectures by new lectures on Linear Algebra

## Examination

There are two compulsory course elements:

* Assignments (written + oral examination in groups of three students)
    * Deadlines: 2017-01-31 and 2017-02-28
* Exam (individual written exam at the end of the course)
    * Date: [2017-03-14 at 14.00](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=24230)
    * Aids: One textbook of your choice

To pass the course you need to pass both course elements.
